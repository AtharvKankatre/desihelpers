                into more broadly worded provisions to allow Desi Wayz more
                flexibility in certain situations. Note also that we did not
                include several provisions or concepts from the existing Terms &
                Conditions for the Site because they did not seem to track what
                was actually happening on the Site (or the App) based on our
                review. If you think differently, or if you think we have

                assigning it a score (&ldquo;DesiHelpers Score&rdquo;). DesiHelpers.com does

                making their decisions about whether to do business with you on
                or through the Site or the App. The Score is intended to reflect

                reviews, and profile views on the Site or the App and other
                information submitted to or gathered by the platform. You
                acknowledge and agree that the DesiHelpers.com Score is not a
                perfect index or other rating of you, your business or any other
                user or business (e.g., information used to compile the Score
                might be incomplete, there may be errors in the scoring system
                based on a number of factors); is not an endorsement, defamation

                under the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &
                Procedures (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;), as supplemented by the Federal

                <b>• Arbitration Process, Location, and Procedures</b>
                <br />
                The Party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall serve a
                written notice of arbitration on the other Party in accordance
                with the JAMS Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Austin,
                Texas, United States of America; or, if that forum is not
                permitted under the JAMS Rules or the arbitrator&quot;s
                interpretation of the JAMS Rules, then in the city where the
                JAMS office in closest proximity to Austin, Texas, United States
                of America is located (with that city currently being Dallas,
                Texas, United States of America). The arbitration shall be
                conducted in the English language. The arbitrator shall be
                selected in accordance with the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise
                agreed to by the parties to the arbitration. All issues or
                questions concerning either the scope of this arbitration clause
                or the arbitrability of any of the Disputes shall be referred to
                and finally decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may
                construe or interpret, but shall not vary or ignore, the terms
                and conditions of this Agreement and shall be bound by
                applicable law.

                <b>• Arbitration Decisions and Awards</b>
                <br />
                The arbitrator shall render a written final decision on the
                subject Dispute as soon as practicable and in any event not more
                than forty-five (45) days after the close of evidence and
                briefing. The arbitrator&quot;s decision shall be written, shall be
                in accordance with applicable law, and shall be supported by
                written findings of fact and conclusions of law setting forth
                the basis for his/her decision. The arbitrator shall have no
                authority to award punitive, exemplary or consequential damages,
                unless such an award is authorized by applicable law. The
                arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorney fees and
                expenses if such an award is permitted under this Agreement or
                applicable law. Subject to any applicable rights of appeal, the
                final decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive
                upon all of the Parties who have been served with proper written
                notice of the arbitration proceeding as required by this section
                26. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                confirmed in any state or federal court having jurisdiction
                thereof that is located in the State of Texas, and may be
                entered in and enforced by any domestic, foreign, or
                international court having appropriate subject matter
                jurisdiction. Any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or
                other determination of the arbitrator and any information
                disclosed in the course of any arbitration hereunder shall be
                kept confidential by the Parties, and any court order to enforce
                the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
                determination of the arbitrator shall be filed under seal.

                JAMS&quot;s administrative and filing fees, the arbitrator&quot;s fees and
                expenses and all other fees and expenses charged by JAMS and/or
                the arbitrator to administer or conduct the arbitration shall be
                shared equally among all parties to the arbitration; provided,
                however, that the prevailing party of the arbitration may
                recover an award of its share of such fees and expenses if such
                an award is permitted under this Agreement or applicable law. o
                Litigation; Waiver In the event a particular Dispute is not
                subject to arbitration (whether by decision of an arbitrator
                with binding authority, or otherwise according to this Agreement
                or applicable law), each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
                exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of
                the State of Texas in Travis County, Texas, United States of
                America and the United States federal courts in the Western
                District of Texas, Austin Division, for the litigation of said
                Dispute, and covenant and agree that neither of the foregoing is
